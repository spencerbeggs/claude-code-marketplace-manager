# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to `@savvy-web/github-action-template`. This document explains how to set up your environment and submit changes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 24.11.0 (see `devEngines` in `package.json`)
- **pnpm** 10.28.2 (enforced via `packageManager` field)
- **Git** with commit signing configured (recommended)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/savvy-web/github-action-template.git
cd github-action-template
pnpm install
```

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm build` | Build the action (produces `dist/main.js`) |
| `pnpm ci:test` | Run tests with coverage |
| `pnpm test` | Run tests without coverage |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome checks (no auto-fix) |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Run Biome with auto-fix (safe fixes only) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking via Turbo |
| `pnpm lint:md` | Lint markdown files |
| `pnpm validate` | Validate GitHub Action metadata |

## Code Quality Standards

- **Formatter:** Biome 2.3.14 -- tabs, 120-character line width
- **Linting:** Biome with strict rules including `noImportCycles`, `useExplicitType` for exports, and `useNodejsImportProtocol`
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, ES2022 target, bundler module resolution
- **Testing:** Vitest with 85% coverage thresholds (per-file)
- **Imports:** Use `.js` extensions in all imports; use `node:` protocol for Node.js built-ins; separate type imports

## Pre-commit Hooks

The repository uses Husky with lint-staged. When you commit:

- TypeScript/JavaScript files are checked and fixed with Biome
- `package.json` files are sorted and formatted
- Markdown files are linted with `markdownlint-cli2`
- YAML files are formatted and validated
- TypeScript changes trigger a full typecheck

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork and branch** -- Create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Make changes** -- Follow the code quality standards above
3. **Add a changeset** -- Run `pnpm changeset` to describe your change
